# My Favrite Fruits

Mye favorite fruits are Apples, Bananas and Orange. I eat they every day, because they is so delicious. Sometimes I mix them altogether and make a fruit salad, which are a healthy snack.

Last week, I buyed some Apples at the grocery store, but when I went to eat it, I noticed that it had some wormholes. That was really disgusting! I think the store should have checked the Apples before selling it to me.

In my opinion, Bananas are the most easier fruit to eat. You don't need a knife or a spoon, you just have to peel it and eat it. And they are also very cheap, so you can buy a bunch of them and eat it for a whole week.

Orange are a great source of Vitamin C, which helps to prevent colds and flu. I usually drink a glass of orange juice every morning to start my day. It's really refreshing!
