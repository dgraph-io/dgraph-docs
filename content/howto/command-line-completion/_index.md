# Command line completion
Command line completion is a common feature provided by shells such as `bash` or `zsh`. It saves you extra typing and helps out when you cannot remember the syntax of a command.

*   [Learn about completion]({{< relref "howto/command-line-completion/about-cli.md" >}}) to understand how it works before you begin using it.
*   [Create completion script]({{< relref "howto/command-line-completion/create-cli.md" >}}) and start using for `dgraph` commands.
