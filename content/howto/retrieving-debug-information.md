Each Dgraph data node exposes profile over `/debug/pprof` endpoint and metrics over `/debug/vars` endpoint. Each Dgraph data node has it's own profiling and metrics information. Below is a list of debugging information exposed by Dgraph and the corresponding commands to retrieve them.

## Metrics Information

If you are collecting these metrics from outside the Dgraph instance you need to pass `--expose_trace=true` flag, otherwise there metrics can be collected by connecting to the instance over localhost.

```
curl http://<IP>:<HTTP_PORT>/debug/vars
```

Metrics can also be retrieved in the Prometheus format at `/debug/prometheus_metrics`. See the [Metrics]({{< relref "deploy/metrics.md" >}}) section for the full list of metrics.

## Profiling Information

Profiling information is available via the `go tool pprof` profiling tool built into Go. The ["Profiling Go programs"](https://blog.golang.org/profiling-go-programs) Go blog post will help you get started with using pprof. Each Dgraph Zero and Dgraph Alpha exposes a debug endpoint at `/debug/pprof/<profile>` via the HTTP port.

```
go tool pprof http://<IP>:<HTTP_PORT>/debug/pprof/heap
Fetching profile from ...
Saved Profile in ...
```
The output of the command would show the location where the profile is stored.

In the interactive pprof shell, you can use commands like `top` to get a listing of the top functions in the profile, `web` to get a visual graph of the profile opened in a web browser, or `list` to display a code listing with profiling information overlaid.

### CPU Profile

```
go tool pprof http://<IP>:<HTTP_PORT>/debug/pprof/profile
```

### Memory Profile

```
go tool pprof http://<IP>:<HTTP_PORT>/debug/pprof/heap
```

### Block Profile

Dgraph by default doesn't collect the block profile. Dgraph must be started with `--profile_mode=block` and `--block_rate=<N>` with N > 1.

```
go tool pprof http://<IP>:<HTTP_PORT>/debug/pprof/block
```

### Goroutine stack

The HTTP page `/debug/pprof/` is available at the HTTP port of a Dgraph Zero or Dgraph Alpha. From this page a link to the "full goroutine stack dump" is available (e.g., on a Dgraph Alpha this page would be at `http://localhost:8080/debug/pprof/goroutine?debug=2`). Looking at the full goroutine stack can be useful to understand goroutine usage at that moment.

## Profiling Information with `debuginfo`

Instead of sending a request to the server for each CPU, Memory, and goroutine profile, you can use the `debuginfo` command to collect all the profiles you need in one go.

You can run the command like this:

```sh
dgraph debuginfo -a <alpha_address:port> -z <zero_address:port> -d <path_to_dir_to_store_profiles> 
```

Your output should look like:

```log

```

When the command finishes, `debuginfo` returns the tarball's file name. In this example, it was saved in `/tmp/dgraph-debuginfo121781350/alpha_trace.gz`.

### Command parameters

```txt
  -a, --alpha string       Address of running dgraph alpha. (default "localhost:8080")
  -x, --archive            Whether to archive the generated report (default true)
  -d, --directory string   Directory to write the debug info into.
  -h, --help               help for debuginfo
  -p, --profiles strings   List of pprof profiles to dump in the report. (default [goroutine,heap,threadcreate,block,mutex,profile,trace])
  -s, --seconds uint32     Duration for time-based profile collection. (default 15)
  -z, --zero string        Address of running dgraph zero.
```

#### The profile flag (`-p`)

By default, `debuginfo` collects:
- `goroutine`
- `heap`
- `threadcreate` 
- `block` 
- `mutex` 
- `profile`
- `trace`

If needed, you can collect some of them (not necessarily all). For example, this command will collect only `goroutine` and `heap` profiles:

```sh
dgraph debuginfo -p goroutine,heap
```

#### The seconds flag (`-s`)

By default, the flag is set to 15 seconds. If you are collecting the CPU profile, this profile needs at least 30 seconds to be collected, therefore when you want to collect it, you need to set the `-s` flag as follows:

```sh
dgraph debuginfo -s 30
```

If you don't set the flag, when collecting a CPU profile you'll will get a `context deadline exceeded` error:

```log
I0120 14:06:49.840613   13589 pprof.go:72] fetching profile over HTTP from http://localhost:8080/debug/pprof/profile?duration=15
I0120 14:06:49.840622   13589 pprof.go:74] please wait... (15s)
E0120 14:07:14.341613   13589 pprof.go:58] error while saving pprof profile from http://localhost:8080/debug/pprof/profile?duration=15: http fetch: Get "http://localhost:8080/debug/pprof/profile?duration=15": context deadline exceeded (Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers)
```

### Profiles details

- `cpu profile`: CPU profile determines where a program spends its time while actively consuming CPU cycles (as opposed to while sleeping or waiting for I/O).

- `heap`: Heap profile reports memory allocation samples; used to monitor current and historical memory usage, and to check for memory leaks.

- `threadcreate`: Thread creation profile reports the sections of the program that lead the creation of new OS threads.

- `goroutine`: Goroutine profile reports the stack traces of all current goroutines.

- `block`: Block profile shows where goroutines block waiting on synchronization primitives (including timer channels). 

- `mutex`: Mutex profile reports the lock contentions. When you think your CPU is not fully utilized due to a mutex contention, use this profile. 

- `trace`: this capture a wide range of runtime events. Execution tracer is a tool to detect latency and utilization problems. You can examine how well the CPU is utilized, and when networking or syscalls are a cause of preemption for the goroutines.
Tracer is useful to identify poorly parallelized execution, understand some of the core runtime events, and how your goroutines execute.
