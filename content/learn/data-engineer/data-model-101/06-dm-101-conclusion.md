Congratulations on finishing the Dgraph learn course: **Graph Data Models 101**!

Now that you have an overview and understanding of
[what a graph is](/courses/datamodel/evolution/develop/graphs-data-modeling/),
how a graph differs from a
[relational model](/courses/datamodel/evolution/develop/graphs-data-modeling/relational-data-model/),
[how to model a graph](/courses/datamodel/evolution/develop/graphs-data-modeling/graph-data-model/),
and [how to query a graph](/courses/datamodel/evolution/develop/query-mod-app/graph-query/),
you are ready to jump into using Dgraph, the only truly native graph database.

Download [Dgraph](https://dgraph.io/graph-db) - it’s open source and freely
available. You can also check out [Dgraph Cloud](https://dgraph.io/cloud),
a fully-managed GraphQL backend database service powered by Dgraph. Whether
you’re frontend, backend, or full-stack focused; Dgraph has a product that’s
right for you.
