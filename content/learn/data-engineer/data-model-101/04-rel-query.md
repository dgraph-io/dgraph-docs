Storing our data is great, but the best data model would be useless without the
ability to query the data our app requires. So, how does information get retrieved in a
relational model compared to a graph model?

In a relational model, tables are stored in files. To support the sample social media app described in this tutorial, you would need four files: `People`, `Posts`, `Comments`, and `Likes`.

When you request data from a file, one of two things happens: either a table scan
takes place or an index is invoked. A table scan happens when filtering upon
data that is not indexed. To find this data, the whole file must be read until
the data is found or the end of the file is reached. In our example app we have
a post titled, “Ice Cream?”. If the title is not indexed, every post in the file
would need to be read until the database finds the post entitled, “Ice Cream?”.
This method would be like reading the entire dictionary to find the definition of a
single word: very time-consuming. This process could be optimized by creating an
index on the post’s title column. Using an index speeds up searches for data,
but it can still be time-consuming.

### What is an index?

An index is an algorithm used to find the location of data. Instead of scanning
an entire file looking for a piece of data, an index is used to aggregate the
data into "chunks" and then create a decision tree pointing to the individual chunks of data. 
Such a decision tree could look like the following:

Relational data models rely heavily on indexes to quickly find the requested
data. Because the data required to answer a single question will usually live
in multiple tables, you must use multiple indexes each time that related data is joined together. 
And because you can't index every column, some types of queries
won't benefit from indexing.

### How data is joined in a relational model

In a relational model, the request's response must be returned as a single
table consisting of columns and rows. To form this single table response, data
from multiple tables must be joined together. In our app example, we found the
post entitled “Ice Cream?” and also found the comments, “Yes!”, “When?”, and
“After Lunch”. Each of these comments also has a corresponding author: `Mother`,
`Child`, and `Father`. Because there is only one post as the root of the
join, the post is duplicated to join to each comment.

Flattening query results can lead to many duplicate rows. Consider the case
where you also want to query which people liked the comments on this example
post. This query requires mapping a many-to-many relationship, which invokes two
additional index searches to get the list of likes by `person`.

Joining all of this together would form a single table containing many
duplicates: duplicate `posts` and duplicate `comments`. Another side effect of
this response approach is that it is likely that empty data will exist in the
response.

In the next section, you will see that querying a graph data model avoids the
issues that you would face when querying a relational data model.
