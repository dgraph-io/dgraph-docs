This tutorial demonstrates how to implement **Jaccard distance** for content-based filtering in Dgraph. You'll learn how to build recommendation systems using graph databases and DQL queries.

## What You'll Learn

- Understanding Jaccard distance and its applications in recommendation systems
- Implementing content-based filtering with Dgraph
- Using DQL variable propagation for similarity calculations
- Building movie recommendation queries step by step
- Optimizing queries for real-world datasets

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of [DQL syntax]({{< relref "/dql/_index.md" >}})
- Familiarity with [DQL functions]({{< relref "/dql/query/functions.md" >}})
- Knowledge of [query variables]({{< relref "/dql/query/variables.md" >}})

## Tutorial Structure

1. [Introduction to Jaccard Distance]({{< relref "introduction.md" >}}) - Understanding the mathematical foundation
2. [Setting Up the Dataset]({{< relref "dataset-setup.md" >}}) - Preparing the Movielens dataset
3. [Basic Jaccard Implementation]({{< relref "basic-implementation.md" >}}) - Your first similarity query
4. [Advanced Techniques]({{< relref "advanced-techniques.md" >}}) - Combining with ratings and optimization
5. [Real-World Applications]({{< relref "applications.md" >}}) - Scaling and production considerations

## Dataset

This tutorial uses the **Movielens ML-100k** dataset, which contains:
- 100,000 ratings from 1,000 users
- 1,700 movies with genre information
- User demographics and movie metadata

The dataset is converted to RDF format and loaded into Dgraph for graph-based analysis.

## Expected Outcomes

By the end of this tutorial, you'll be able to:
- Implement Jaccard distance calculations in DQL
- Build content-based recommendation systems
- Understand variable propagation in graph queries
- Apply these techniques to your own datasets
