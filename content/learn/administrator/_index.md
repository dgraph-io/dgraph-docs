### Recommended learning path
- Go to [Clients]({{< relref "clients/_index.md" >}}) to see how to communicate
with Dgraph from your application.
- Take the [Tour](https://dgraph.io/tour/) for a guided tour of how to write queries in Dgraph.
- A wider range of queries can also be found in the [Query Language]({{< relref "query-language/_index.md" >}}) reference.
- See [Deploy]({{< relref "deploy/_index.md" >}}) if you wish to run Dgraph
  in a cluster.
