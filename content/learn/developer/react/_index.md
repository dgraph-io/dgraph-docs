In this tutorial, you will start by looking at the app you are going to build
and how such an app works in Dgraph Cloud. Then, the tutorial moves on to
schema design with GraphQL, implementing a UI. In future expansions of Dgraph's
React tutorials, you will add login, authorization, subscriptions and custom 
logic to this app. 

You can complete this tutorial using [Dgraph Cloud](https://cloud.dgraph.io/).
