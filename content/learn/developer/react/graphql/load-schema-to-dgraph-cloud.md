With the schema defined, it's just one step to get a running GraphQL backend for
the app.

Copy the schema, navigate to the **Schema** tab in Dgraph Cloud, paste the schema in, and press **Deploy**.

As soon as the schema is added, Dgraph Cloud generates and deploys a GraphQL API for the app.

Next you'll learn about GraphQL operations like queries, mutations and
subscriptions.
