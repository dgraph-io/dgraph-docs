Charts is a sample app that lets users build online charts using metrics that
they provide. For example, you could provide this app with data from an
e-commerce site and use it to track site statistics such as the number of page
views and revenue. This app demonstrates how to use React hooks with Apollo
client to add and read related data. The repo for this app can be found on
GitHub at [dgraph.io/graphql-sample-apps/charting](https://github.com/dgraph-io/graphql-sample-apps/tree/master/charting).
