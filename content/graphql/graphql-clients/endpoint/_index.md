When you deploy a GraphQL schema, Dgraph serves the corresponding  [spec-compliant GraphQL](https://graphql.github.io/graphql-spec/June2018/) API at the HTTP endpoint `/graphql`. GraphQL requests can be sent via HTTP POST or HTTP GET requests.


### Getting your GraphQL Endpoint

{{% tabs %}} {{< tab "Dgraph Cloud" >}}

{{< tab "On prem" >}}

``/graphql`` is served by the Alpha nodes of the Dgraph cluster on the HTTP-external-public port. Refer to [ports usage]({{< relref "ports-usage" >}}).

For a local install the graphql endpoint would be

```
http://localhost:8080/graphql
```
The URL depends on your configuration and specifically 
- the port offset defined by ``--port_offset`` option of the dgraph alpha command.
- the configuration of TLS for https.
- the usage of a load balancer.
