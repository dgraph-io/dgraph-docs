When building an application in React, Vue, Svelte or any of you favorite framework, using a GraphQL client is a must.

As Dgraph serves a [spec-compliant GraphQL](https://graphql.github.io/graphql-spec/June2018/) API from your schema, supports instropection and GraphQL subscriptions, the integration with GraphQL UI client is seamless.

Here is a not limited list of popular GraphQL UI clients that you can use with Dgraph to build applications:
- [graphql-request](https://github.com/jasonkuhrt/graphql-request)
- [URQL](https://github.com/urql-graphql/urql])
- [Apollo client](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client)
