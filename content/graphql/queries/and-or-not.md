Every GraphQL search filter can use `and`, `or` and `not` operators.

GraphQL syntax uses infix notation, so: "a and b" is `a, and: { b }`, "a or b or c" is `a, or: { b, or: c }`, and "not" is a prefix (`not:`).

Example: Posts that do not have "GraphQL" in the title.

```graphql
queryPost(filter: { not: { title: { allofterms: "GraphQL"} } } ) { ... }
```

Example: Posts that have "GraphQL" or "Dgraph" in the title.

```graphql
queryPost(filter: {
    title: { allofterms: "GraphQL"},
    or: { title: { allofterms: "Dgraph" } }
  } ) { ... }
```

Example: Posts that have "GraphQL" and "Dgraph" in the title.

```graphql
queryPost(filter: {
    title: { allofterms: "GraphQL"},
    and: { title: { allofterms: "Dgraph" } }
  } ) { ... }
```

The "and" operator is implicit for a single filter object, if the fields don't overlap.  For example, above the `and` is required because `title` is in both filters, whereas below, `and` is not required.

```graphql
queryPost(filter: {
    title: { allofterms: "GraphQL" },
    datePublished: { ge: "2020-06-15" }
  } ) { ... }
```

Example: Posts that have "GraphQL" in the title, or have the tag "GraphQL" and mention "Dgraph" in the title

```graphql
queryPost(filter: {
    title: { allofterms: "GraphQL"},
    or: { title: { allofterms: "Dgraph" }, tags: { eq: "GraphQL" } }
  } ) { ... }
```

The `and` and `or` filter both accept a list of filters. Per the GraphQL specification, non-list filters are coerced into a list. This provides backwards compatibility while allowing for more complex filters.

Example: Query for posts that have `GraphQL` in the title but that lack the `GraphQL` tag, or that have `Dgraph` in the title but lack the `Dgraph` tag.

```graphql
queryPost(filter: {
    or: [
      and: [{ title: { allofterms: "GraphQL" } }, { not: { tags: { eq: "GraphQL" } } }]
      and: [{ title: { allofterms: "Dgraph" } }, { not: { tags: { eq: "Dgraph" } } }]
    ]
  } ) { ... }
```
