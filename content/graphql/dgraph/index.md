## How to use GraphQL on an existing Dgraph instance

If you have an existing Dgraph instance and want to also expose GraphQL, you need to add a GraphQL schema that maps to your Dgraph schema.  You don't need to expose your entire Dgraph schema as GraphQL, but do note that adding a GraphQL schema can alter the Dgraph schema.

Dgraph's native DQL syntax allows type and edge names that aren't valid in GraphQL; so, you'll often need to expose valid GraphQL names. Dgraph permits special characters, including Unicode characters from a variety of  languages (see [Predicate name rules]({{< relref "query-language/schema.md#predicate-name-rules">}})). Conversely, the [GraphQL specification on naming](https://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#sec-Names) requires that entity names, including types and fields (predicate), are composed of ASCII characters and generated as follows: `/[_A-Za-z][_0-9A-Za-z]*/`.

Be careful with mapping to an existing Dgraph instance. Updating the GraphQL schema will also update the underlying Dgraph schema.

## Mapping GraphQL to a Dgraph schema

By default, Dgraph generates a new predicate for each field in a GraphQL type. The name of the generated predicate is composed of the type name followed by a dot `.` and ending with the field name. Therefore, two different types with fields of the same name will turn out to be different Dgraph predicates and can have different indexes.  For example, the types:

```graphql
type Person {
    name: String @search(by: [hash])
    age: Int
}

type Movie {
    name: String @search(by: [term])
}
```

generate a Dgraph schema like:

```graphql
type Person {
    Person.name
    Person.age
}

type Movie {
    Movie.name
}

Person.name: string @index(hash) .
Person.age: int .
Movie.name: string @index(term) .
```

This behavior can be customized with the `@dgraph` directive.  

* `type T @dgraph(type: "DgraphType")` controls what Dgraph type is used for a GraphQL type.
* `field: SomeType @dgraph(pred: "DgraphPredicate")` controls what Dgraph predicate is mapped to a GraphQL field.

For example, if you have existing types that don't match GraphQL requirements, you can create a schema like the following.

```graphql
type Person @dgraph(type: "Human-Person") {
    name: String @search(by: [hash]) @dgraph(pred: "name")
    age: Int
}

type Movie @dgraph(type: "film") {
    name: String @search(by: [term]) @dgraph(pred: "film.name")
}
```

Which maps to the Dgraph schema:

```graphql
type Human-Person {
    name
    Person.age
}

type film {
    film.name
}

name string @index(hash) .
Person.age: int .
film.name string @index(term) .
```

You might also have the situation where you have used `name` for both movie names and people's names.  In this case you can map fields in two different GraphQL types to the one Dgraph predicate.

```graphql
type Person {
    name: String @dgraph(pred: "name")
    ...
}

type Movie {
    name: String @dgraph(pred: "name")
    ...
}
```

In Dgraph's current GraphQL implementation, if two fields are mapped to the same Dgraph predicate, both should have the same `@search` directive.

## Language support in GraphQL

In your GraphQL schema, you need to define a field for each language that you want to use. 
In addition, you also need to apply the `@dgraph(pred: "...")` directive on that field, with the `pred` argument set to point to the correct DQL predicate with a language tag for the language that you want to use it for.
Dgraph will automatically add a `@lang` directive in the DQL schema for the corresponding predicate.

{{% notice "tip" %}}
By default, the DQL predicate for a GraphQL field is generated as `Typename.FieldName`.
{{% /notice %}}

For example:

```graphql
type Person {
     name: String   # Person.name is the auto-generated DQL predicate for this GraphQL field, unless overridden using @dgraph(pred: "...")
     nameHi: String @dgraph(pred:"Person.name@hi") # this field exposes the value for the language tag `@hi` for the DQL predicate `Person.name` to GraphQL
     nameEn: String @dgraph(pred:"Person.name@en")
     nameHi_En:  String @dgraph(pred:"Person.name@hi:en") # this field uses multiple language tags: `@hi` and `@en`
     nameHi_En_untag:  String @dgraph(pred:"Person.name@hi:en:.") # as this uses `.`, it will give untagged values if there is no value for `@hi` or `@en`
  }
```

If a GraphQL field uses more than one language tag, then it won't be part of any mutation input. Like, in the above example the fields `nameHi_En` and `nameHi_En_untag` can't be given as an input to any mutation. Only the fields which use one or no language can be given in a mutation input, like `name`, `nameHi`, and `nameEn`.

All the fields can be queried, irrespective of whether they use one language or more.

{{% notice "note" %}}
GraphQL wonâ€™t be able to query `Person.name@*` type of language tags because of the structural requirements of GraphQL.
