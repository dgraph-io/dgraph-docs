The latest Dgraph release is the v22.00 series.

Dgraph releases starting with v20.03 follow
[calendar versioning](https://calver.org). To learn more about our switch from
semantic to calendar versioning, and why v2-v19 don't exist as a result of this
switch, see our Blog post on the 
[switch to calendar versioning](https://dgraph.io/blog/post/dgraph-calendar-versioning/).
