## DQL
DQL is the "Dgraph Query Language" and is based on GraphQL. It is neither a superset nor subset of GraphQL, but is generally more powerful than GraphQL. DQL coexists nicely with GraphQL so many users perform most access using GraphQL and only "drop down" into DQL when there is a particular query mechanism needed that is not supported in the GraphQL spec. E.g. @recurse query operations are only in DQL. Other customers simply use DQL. DQL supports both queries and mutations, as well as hybrid "upsert" operations.
