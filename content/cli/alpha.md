The `dgraph alpha` command runs Dgraph Alpha database nodes, which store data and serve queries in your deployment.

## Overview

A Dgraph Alpha instance stores the data. Each Dgraph Alpha is responsible for storing and serving one data group. If multiple Alphas serve the same group, they form a Raft group and provide synchronous replication.

## Usage

```bash
dgraph alpha [flags]
```

## Key Flags

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `-p, --postings` | Directory to store posting lists | `"p"` |
| `-w, --wal` | Directory to store raft write-ahead logs | `"w"` |
| `--tmp` | Directory to store temporary buffers | `"t"` |
| `-z, --zero` | Comma separated list of Dgraph Zero addresses | `"localhost:5080"` |
| `--my` | Address:port of this server for cluster communication | |
| `-o, --port_offset` | Value added to all listening port numbers [Internal=7080, HTTP=8080, Grpc=9080] | `0` |
| `--export` | Folder in which to store exports | `"export"` |
| `--custom_tokenizers` | Comma separated list of tokenizer plugins for custom indices | |

## Superflags

Alpha uses several [superflags]({{< relref "superflags.md" >}}) for advanced configuration:

- `--acl` - Access Control List settings (Enterprise)
- `--audit` - Audit logging configuration
