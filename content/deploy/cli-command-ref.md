You can use the Dgraph command-line interface (CLI) to deploy and manage Dgraph.
You use it in self-managed deployment scenarios; such as running Dgraph on
on-premises servers hosted on your physical infrastructure, or running Dgraph in
the cloud on your AWS, GCP, or Azure infrastructure. 

Dgraph has a root command used throughout its CLI: `dgraph`. The `dgraph` command
is supported by multiple subcommands (such as `alpha` or `update`), some of which
are also supported by their own subcommands. For example, the `dgraph acl`
command requires you to specify one of its subcommands: `add`, `del`, `info` or
`mod`. As with other CLIs, you provide command options using flags like `--help`
or `--telemetry`. 

{{% notice "tip" %}}
The term *command* is used instead of *subcommand* throughout this document, 
except when clarifying relationships in the CLI command hierarchy. The
term *command* is also used for combinations of commands and their subcommands,
such as `dgraph alpha debug`.

## Dgraph CLI superflags in release v21.03

Some flags are deprecated and replaced in release v21.03. In previous Dgraph
releases, multiple related flags are often used in a command, causing some 
commands to be very long. Starting in release v21.03, Dgraph uses *superflags* 
for some flags used by the most complex commands: `alpha`, `backup`, `bulk`,
`debug`, `live` and `zero`. Superflags are compound flags: they contain one or
more options that let you define multiple settings in a semicolon-delimited list.
Semicolons are required between superflag options, but a semicolon after the last
superflag option is optional.

The general syntax for superflags is as follows: `--<super-flag-name> option-a=value; option-b=value`

{{% notice "note" %}}
You should encapsulate the options for a superflag in double-quotes (`"`) if any
of those option values include spaces. You can also encapsulate options in
double-quotes to improve readability. So, you can also use the following
syntax for superflags: `--<super-flag-name> "option-a=value; option-b=value"`.
{{% /notice %}}

Release v21.03 includes the following superflags:
* `--acl`
* `--badger`
* `--graphql`
* `--limit`
* `--ludicrous`
* `--raft`
* `--security`
* `--telemetry`
* `--tls`
* `--trace`
* `--vault`

For example, the following command that is valid in release v20.11 is no longer
valid starting in release v21.03:

```sh
dgraph alpha --ludicrous_mode=true ludicrous_concurrency=16
```

Instead, you can express this command as follows starting in release v21.03:

```sh

dgraph alpha --ludicrous enabled=true; concurrency=16;
```

The following table maps Dgraph CLI flags from release v20.11 and earlier that
have been replaced by superflags (and their options) in release v21.03. Any flags
not shown here are unchanged in release v21.03.

### Dgraph core commands

Dgraph core commands provide core deployment and management functionality
for the Dgraph Alpha database nodes and Dgraph Zero management nodes in your
deployment.

#### `dgraph alpha`

This command is used to configure and run the Dgraph Alpha database nodes in
your deployment. The following replicates the help listing for `dgraph alpha --help`:


```shell

storing and serving one data group. If multiple Alphas serve the same group,
they form a Raft group and provide synchronous replication.

#### `dgraph restore`

This command loads objects from available backups. The following replicates the
help listing shown when you run `dgraph restore --help`:

```shell
Restore loads objects created with the backup feature in Dgraph Enterprise Edition (EE).

Backups are originated from HTTP at /admin/backup, then can be restored using CLI restore
command. Restore is intended to be used with new Dgraph clusters in offline state.

The --location flag indicates a source URI with Dgraph backup objects. This URI supports all
the schemes used for backup.

Source URI formats:
 [scheme]://[host]/[path]?[args]
 [scheme]:///[path]?[args]
 /[path]?[args] (only for local or NFS)

Source URI parts:
 scheme - service handler, one of: "s3", "minio", "file"
   host - remote address. ex: "dgraph.s3.amazonaws.com"
   path - directory, bucket or container at target. ex: "/dgraph/backups/"
   args - specific arguments that are ok to appear in logs.

The --posting flag sets the posting list parent dir to store the loaded backup files.

Using the --zero flag will use a Dgraph Zero address to update the start timestamp using
the restored version. Otherwise, the timestamp must be manually updated through Zero's HTTP
'assign' command.

Dgraph backup creates a unique backup object for each node group, and restore will create
a posting directory 'p' matching the backup group ID. Such that a backup file
named '.../r32-g2.backup' will be loaded to posting dir 'p2'.

Usage examples:

# Restore from local dir or NFS mount:
$ dgraph restore -p . -l /var/backups/dgraph

# Restore from S3:
$ dgraph restore -p /var/db/dgraph -l s3://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/srfrog/dgraph

# Restore from dir and update Ts:
$ dgraph restore -p . -l /var/backups/dgraph -z localhost:5080

    
Usage:
 dgraph restore [flags] 

Flags:
     --backup_id string             The ID of the backup series to restore. If empty, it will restore the latest series.

     --encryption_key_file string   The file that stores the symmetric key of length 16, 24, or 32 bytes. The key size determines the chosen AES cipher (AES-128, AES-192, and AES-256 respectively). Enterprise feature.
     --force_zero                   If false, no connection to a zero in the cluster will be required. Keep in mind this requires you to manually update the timestamp and max uid when you start the cluster. The correct values are printed near the end of this command's output. (default true)
