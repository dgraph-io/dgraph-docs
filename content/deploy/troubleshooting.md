This page provides tips on how to troubleshoot issues with running Dgraph.

### Running out of memory (OOM)

When you [bulk load]({{< relref "deploy/fast-data-loading/bulk-loader.md" >}})
or [backup]({{< relref "/enterprise-features/binary-backups.md" >}}) your data,
Dgraph can consume more memory than usual due to a high volume of writes. This
can cause OOM crashes.

You can take the following steps to help avoid OOM crashes:

* **Increase the amount of memory available**: If you run Dgraph with insufficient
memory, that can result in OOM crashes. The recommended minimum RAM to run Dgraph
on desktops and laptops (single-host deployment) is 16GB. For servers in a 
cluster deployment, the recommended minimum is 8GB per server. This applies to
EC2 and GCE instances, as well as on-premises servers.
* **Reduce the number of Go routines**: You can troubleshoot OOM issues by reducing
the number of Go routines (`goroutines`) used by Dgraph from the default value
of eight. For example, you can reduce the `goroutines` that Dgraph uses to four
by calling the `dgraph alpha` command with the following option: 

  `--badger "goroutines=4"`


### "Too many open files" errors

If Dgraph logs "too many open files" errors, you should increase the per-process
open file descriptor limit to permit more open files. During normal operations,
Dgraph must be able to open many files. Your operating system may have an open 
file descriptor limit with a low default value that isn't adequate for a database
like Dgraph. If so, you might need to increase this limit.

On Linux and Mac, you can get file descriptor limit settings with the `ulimit`
command, as follows:

* Get hard limit: `ulimit -n -H`
* Get soft limit: `ulimit -n -S`


A soft limit of 65535 open files is the recommended minimum to use Dgraph in
production, but you can try increasing this soft limit if you continue to see 
this error. To learn more, see the `ulimit` documentation for your operating
system.
