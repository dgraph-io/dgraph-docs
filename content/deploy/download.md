{{% notice "note" %}}
Be aware that using this script will overwrite the installed version and can lead to compatibility problems. For example, if you were using version v1.0.5 and forced the installation of {{< version >}}-Beta, the existing data won't be compatible with the new version. The data must be [exported]({{< relref "deploy/dgraph-administration.md#exporting-database" >}}) before running this script and reimported to the new cluster running the updated version.

## Manual download [optional]

If you don't want to follow the automatic installation method, you could manually download the appropriate tar for your platform from **[Dgraph releases](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/releases)**. After downloading the tar for your platform from Github, extract the binary to `/usr/local/bin` like so.

```sh
# For Linux
$ sudo tar -C /usr/local/bin -xzf dgraph-linux-amd64-VERSION.tar.gz

# For Mac
$ sudo tar -C /usr/local/bin -xzf dgraph-darwin-amd64-VERSION.tar.gz

# Test that it worked fine, by running:
dgraph
```

## Install from Source

{{% notice "note" %}}
You can build the Ratel UI from source separately following its build
[instructions](https://github.com/dgraph-io/ratel/blob/master/INSTRUCTIONS.md).
Ratel UI is distributed via Dgraph releases using any of the download methods
listed above.
{{% /notice %}}

If you want to install from source, install Go 1.13+ or later and the following dependencies:

#### Ubuntu

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```

#### macOS

As a prerequisite, first install [XCode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) (or the [XCode Command-line Tools](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/)) and [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

Next, install the required dependencies:

```bash
brew update
brew install jemalloc go
```

### Build and Install

Then clone the Dgraph repository and use `make install` to install the Dgraph binary in the directory named by the GOBIN environment variable, which defaults to $GOPATH/bin or $HOME/go/bin if the GOPATH environment variable is not set. 


```bash
git clone https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph.git
cd dgraph
make install
```
