Multi-tenancy is an enterprise-only feature that allows various tenants to co-exist in the same Dgraph
cluster using `uint64` namespaces. With multi-tenancy, each tenant can only log into their own
namespace and operate in their own namespace.

{{% notice "note" %}}
Multi-tenancy is an enterprise feature and needs [Access Control Lists]({{< relref "access-control-lists.md" >}}) (ACL) enabled to work.
{{% /notice %}}

## Overview

Multi-tenancy is built upon [Access Control Lists]({{< relref "access-control-lists.md" >}}) (ACL), 
and enables multiple tenants to share a Dgraph cluster using unique namespaces.
The tenants are logically separated, and their data lies in the same `p` directory.
Each namespace has a group guardian, which has root access to that namespace.

The default namespace is called a `galaxy`. [Guardians of the Galaxy](#guardians-of-the-galaxy) get
special access to create or delete namespaces and change passwords of
users of other namespaces.

## Namespace

A multi-tenancy Namespace acts as a logical silo, so data stored in one namespace is not accessible from another namespace.
Each namespace has a group guardian (with root access to that namespace), and a unique `uint64` identifier. 
Users are members of a single namespace, and cross-namespace queries are not allowed.

{{% notice "note" %}}
If a user wants to access multiple namespaces, the user needs to be created separately for each namespace.
{{% /notice %}}

The default namespace (`0x00`) is called a `galaxy`. A [Guardian of the Galaxy](#guardians-of-the-galaxy) has
special access to create or delete namespaces and change passwords of
users of other namespaces.

## Access Control Lists

Multi-tenancy defines certain ACL roles for the shared cluster:

- [Guardians of the Galaxy](#guardians-of-the-galaxy) (Super Admins) 
- Guardians of the Namespace
  - They can add users to groups inside the namespace
  - They can remove users from groups inside the namespace
  - They can export their namespace
- Normal users
  - They can login into a namespace
  - They can query in their namespace
  - They can mutate in their namespace
  - They can't query or mutate across namespaces

### Guardians of the Galaxy

A _Guardian of the Galaxy_ is a Super Admin of the default namespace (`0x00`).

As a super-admin, a _Guardian of the Galaxy_ can: 
- [Create](#create-a-namespace) and [delete](#delete-a-namespace) namespaces
- Add new users and guardians to any namespace
- Reset the passwords
- Query and mutate the default namespace (`0x00`)
- Trigger cluster-wide [backups](#backups) (no namespace-specific backup)
- Trigger cluster-wide or namespace-specific [exports](#exports) (exports contain information about the namespace)

For example, if the user `rocket` is part of the _Guardians of the Galaxy_ group (namespace `0x00`),
he can only read/write on namespace `0x00`, but he can create new namespaces and add users to them.

## Create a Namespace

Only members of the [Guardians of the Galaxy](#guardians-of-the-galaxy) group can create a namespace.
A namespace can be created by calling `/admin` with the `addNamespace` mutation,
and will return the assigned number for the new namespace.

{{% notice "note" %}}
To create a namespace, the _Guardian_ must send the JWT access token in the `X-Dgraph-AccessToken` header.
{{% /notice %}}

For example, to create a new namespace:

```graphql
mutation {
 addNamespace
  {
    namespaceId
    message
  }
}
```

## Delete a Namespace

Only members of the [Guardians of the Galaxy](#guardians-of-the-galaxy) group can delete a namespace.
A namespace can be dropped by calling `/admin` with the `deleteNamespace` mutation.

{{% notice "note" %}}
To delete a namespace, the _Guardian_ must send the JWT access token in the `X-Dgraph-AccessToken` header.
{{% /notice %}}

For example, to drop the namespace `0x123`:

```graphql
mutation {
  deleteNamespace(input: {namespaceId: 0x123})
  {
    namespaceId
    message
  }
}
```

{{% notice "note" %}}
Members of `namespace-guardians` can't delete namespaces, they can only perform queries and mutations.
{{% /notice %}}

## Reset passwords

Only members of the _Guardians of the Galaxy_ can reset passwords across namespaces.
A password can be reset by calling `/admin` with the `resetPassword` mutation.

For example, to reset the password for user `groot` from the namespace `100`:

```graphql
mutation {
  resetPassword(input: {userId: "groot", password:"newpassword", namespace: 100}) {
    userId
    message
  }
}
```

## Backups

Backups are currently cluster-wide only, but [exports](#exports) can be created by namespace.
Only a [Guardian of the Galaxy](#guardians-of-the-galaxy) can trigger a backup.

{{% notice "tip" %}}
[Live loader]({{< relref "live-loader.md" >}}) supports loading data into specific namespaces.
{{% /notice %}}


## Exports

Exports can be generated cluster-wide or at namespace level.
The export function creates a new folder for each namespace, and each folder contains the exported `.rdf` and schema file.
These exported sets of `.rdf` files and schemas include the multi-tenancy namespace information.

If a _Guardian of the Galaxy_ exports the whole cluster, a single folder containing the export data of all the namespaces in a single `.rdf` file and a single schema will be generated.

{{% notice "note" %}}
Guardians of a Namespace can trigger an Export for their namespace.
{{% /notice %}}

A namespace-specific export will contain the namespace value in the generated `.rdf` file: 

```rdf
<0x01> "name" "ibrahim" <0x12> .     -> this belongs to namespace 0x12
<0x01> "name" "ibrahim" <0x0> .      -> this belongs to namespace 0x00
```

For example, to export the namespace `0x1234` to a folder in the export directory (by default this directory is `export`):

```graphql
mutation {
  export(input: {format: "rdf", namespace: 0x1234}) {
    response {
      message
    }
  }
}
```

To export all the namespaces: (this is only valid for _Guardians of the Galaxy_)

```graphql
mutation {
  export(input: {format: "rdf"}) {
    response {
      message
    }
  }
}
```

{{% notice "note" %}}
For _Guardians of the Galaxy_, if you don't define a namespace it will export data for every namespace.
{{% /notice %}}
