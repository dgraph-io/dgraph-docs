### Provision a backend

[Dgraph Cloud](https://cloud.dgraph.io/) and you'll arrive at the dashboard

2. Click the **Launch New Backend** button and you'll be taken to a
screen to enter the details of the backend.


  Name the backend, optionally set a subdomain (if left blank, Dgraph Cloud picks
a random domain for you), and then pick a region to deploy you GraphQL backend to.

That's it!  You now have a running Dgraph backend.  Time to build an app.

The URL listed in "GraphQL Endpoint" is the URL at which Dgraph Cloud will serve data to your app.

You can copy it at any time to use in a GraphQL client application.
