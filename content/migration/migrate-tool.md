You can use the Dgraph migration tool to convert a MySQL database tables into a schema and RDF file, and then load the resulting dataset into Dgraph.

## Deriving a Dgraph schema from SQL

Before converting the data, the migration tool needs to derive the schema of each predicate.
Dgraph follows two simple rules for converting the schema:

1. For plain attributes, there is usually a one-to-one mapping between a SQL data type and the
Dgraph datatype. For instance, a `Body` column in the `Posts` table is of type `text`,
and hence, the predicate `posts.Body` is of type `string`: `posts.Body: string .`
2. The predicates representing inter-object relationships, like `posts.OwnerUserId.`, simply have the type
`[uid]`, meaning following the predicate leads us to a set of other objects.

### Using the Migration tool
You can run the Dgraph migrate tool using this command:

```sh
dgraph migrate [flags]
```
1. Create a `config.properties` file that has the following settings and values should not be in quotes:

    ```txt
    user = <SQL_DB_USERNAME>
    password = <SQL_DB_PASSWORD>
    db = <SQL_DB>
    ```

2. Export the SQL database into `schema.txt` and `sql.rdf` file:

    ```sh
    dgraph migrate --config config.properties --output_schema schema.txt --output_data sql.rdf
    ```

    An output similar to this appears:

    ```txt
    Dumping table xyz
    Dumping table constraints xyz
    ...
    ```

{{% notice "note" %}}
If you are connecting to a remote DB hosted on AWS, GCP, and others, you need to pass the flags `--host`, and `--port`.
For description of the various flags in the migration tool, see [command line options]({{< relref "about-data-migration.md" >}}).
{{% /notice %}}

After the migration is complete, two new files are available:

- an RDF file `sql.rdf` containing all the N-Quad entries
- a schema file `schema.txt`.

### Importing the data

The two files can then be imported into Dgraph using the [Dgraph Live Loader]({{< relref "live-loader.md" >}})
or [Bulk Loader]({{< relref "bulk-loader.md" >}}). Sometimes you might want to customize your schema.
For example, you might add an index to a predicate, or change an inter-object predicate (edge) from
unidirectional to bidirectional by adding the `@reverse` directive. If you would like such customizations, you should do it by editing the schema file generated by the migration tool before feeding the files to the Live Loader or Bulk Loader.

* To import the data into Dgraph using the Live Loader to Dgraph Zero and Alpha servers running on the default ports use:

    ```sh
    dgraph live -z localhost:5080 -a localhost:9080 --files sql.rdf --format=rdf --schema schema.txt
    ```
* To import data to Dgraph Cloud use:
    ```sh
     dgraph live --slash_grpc_endpoint=<grpc-endpoint>:443 -f sql.rdf --format=rdf --schema schema.txt -t <api-token>
    ```
   For detailed instructions to import data to Dgraph cloud, see [import data](https://dgraph.io/docs/cloud/admin/import-export/).
