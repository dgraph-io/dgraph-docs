The upsert block contains one query block and mutation blocks. Variables defined
in the query block can be used in the mutation blocks using the `uid` and `val` function.

The `uid` function allows extracting UIDs from variables defined in the query block.
There are two possible outcomes based on the results of executing the query block:

* If the variable is empty i.e. no node matched the query, the `uid` function returns a new UID in case of a `set` operation and is thus treated similar to a blank node. On the other hand, for `delete/del` operation, it returns no UID, and thus the operation becomes a no-op and is silently ignored. A blank node gets the same UID across all the mutation blocks.
* If the variable stores one or more than one UIDs, the `uid` function returns all the UIDs stored in the variable. In this case, the operation is performed on all the UIDs returned, one at a time.


## Example of `uid` Function

Consider an example with the following schema:

```sh
curl localhost:8080/alter -X POST -d $'
  name: string @index(term) .
  email: string @index(exact, trigram) @upsert .
  age: int @index(int) .' | jq
```

Now, let's say we want to create a new user with `email` and `name` information.
We also want to make sure that one email has exactly one corresponding user in
the database. To achieve this, we need to first query whether a user exists
in the database with the given email. If a user exists, we use its UID
to update the `name` information. If the user doesn't exist, we create
a new user and update the `email` and `name` information.

We can do this using the upsert block as follows:

```sh
curl -H "Content-Type: application/rdf" -X POST localhost:8080/mutate?commitNow=true -d $'
upsert {
  query {
    q(func: eq(email, "user@company1.io")) {
      v as uid
      name
    }
  }

  mutation {
    set {
      uid(v) <name> "first last" .
      uid(v) <email> "user@company1.io" .
    }
  }
}' | jq
```

Result:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "q": [],
    "code": "Success",
    "message": "Done",
    "uids": {
      "uid(v)": "0x1"
    }
  },
  "extensions": {...}
}
```

The query part of the upsert block stores the UID of the user with the provided email
in the variable `v`. The mutation part then extracts the UID from variable `v`, and
stores the `name` and `email` information in the database. If the user exists,
the information is updated. If the user doesn't exist, `uid(v)` is treated
as a blank node and a new user is created as explained above.

If we run the same mutation again, the data would just be overwritten, and no new uid is
created. Note that the `uids` map is empty in the result when the mutation is executed
again and the `data` map (key `q`) contains the uid that was created in the previous upsert.

```json
{
  "data": {
    "q": [
      {
        "uid": "0x1",
        "name": "first last"
      }
    ],
    "code": "Success",
    "message": "Done",
    "uids": {}
  },
  "extensions": {...}
}
```

We can achieve the same result using `json` dataset as follows:

```sh
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST localhost:8080/mutate?commitNow=true -d '
{
  "query": "{ q(func: eq(email, \"user@company1.io\")) {v as uid, name} }",
  "set": {
    "uid": "uid(v)",
    "name": "first last",
    "email": "user@company1.io"
  }
}' | jq
```

Now, we want to add the `age` information for the same user having the same email
`user@company1.io`. We can use the upsert block to do the same as follows:

```sh
curl -H "Content-Type: application/rdf" -X POST localhost:8080/mutate?commitNow=true -d $'
upsert {
  query {
    q(func: eq(email, "user@company1.io")) {
      v as uid
    }
  }

  mutation {
    set {
      uid(v) <age> "28" .
    }
  }
}' | jq
```

Result:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "q": [
      {
        "uid": "0x1"
      }
    ],
    "code": "Success",
    "message": "Done",
    "uids": {}
  },
  "extensions": {...}
}
```

Here, the query block queries for a user with `email` as `user@company1.io`. It stores
the `uid` of the user in variable `v`. The mutation block then updates the `age` of the
user by extracting the uid from the variable `v` using `uid` function.

We can achieve the same result using `json` dataset as follows:

```sh
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST localhost:8080/mutate?commitNow=true -d $'
{
  "query": "{ q(func: eq(email, \\"user@company1.io\\")) {v as uid} }",
  "set":{
    "uid": "uid(v)",
    "age": "28"
  }
}' | jq
```

If we want to execute the mutation only when the user exists, we could use
[Conditional Upsert]({{< relref "dql-mutation.md#conditional-upsert" >}}).



## Bulk Delete Example

Let's say we want to delete all the users of `company1` from the database. This can be
achieved in just one query using the upsert block as follows:

```sh
curl -H "Content-Type: application/rdf" -X POST localhost:8080/mutate?commitNow=true -d $'
upsert {
  query {
    v as var(func: regexp(email, /.*@company1.io$/))
  }

  mutation {
    delete {
      uid(v) <name> * .
      uid(v) <email> * .
      uid(v) <age> * .
    }
  }
}' | jq
```

We can achieve the same result using `json` dataset as follows:

```sh
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST localhost:8080/mutate?commitNow=true -d '{
  "query": "{ v as var(func: regexp(email, /.*@company1.io$/)) }",
  "delete": {
    "uid": "uid(v)",
    "name": null,
    "email": null,
    "age": null
  }
}' | jq
```
