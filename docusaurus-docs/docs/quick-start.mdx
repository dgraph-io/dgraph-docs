Welcome to Dgraph! This guide will get you up and running in minutes. You'll learn how to start Dgraph, load sample data, and run your first queries.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed and running
- A terminal window
- About 5 minutes

## Step 1: Start Dgraph

Run Dgraph using the official Docker image:

```bash
docker run --detach --name dgraph-play \
  -v $(pwd):/dgraph \
  -p "8080:8080" \
  -p "9080:9080" \
  dgraph/standalone:v24.1.4
```

This command:
- Starts Dgraph in the background (`--detach`)
- Names the container `dgraph-play` for easy management
- Mounts your current directory to `/dgraph` in the container
- Exposes ports 8080 (HTTP) and 9080 (gRPC)

**Verify it's running:**

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/health | jq
```

You should see a healthy status response. If you don't have `jq` installed, you can remove it from the command.

## Step 2: Load Sample Data

Download the sample dataset (movie data):

```bash
wget https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph-benchmarks/raw/refs/heads/main/data/1million.rdf.gz
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dgraph-io/dgraph-benchmarks/refs/heads/main/data/1million.schema
```

Load the data into Dgraph:

```bash
docker exec -it dgraph-play dgraph live \
  -f 1million.rdf.gz \
  -s 1million.schema
```

This loads over 1 million movie-related facts into your database. The process takes about 15-30 seconds.

## Step 3: Open Ratel UI

[Ratel](dgraph-glossary#ratel) is Dgraph's visual query interface. Start it with:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 8000:8000 dgraph/ratel:latest
```

Then:
1. Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser
2. Enter `http://localhost:8080` as the Dgraph connection string
3. Click **Connect**

<!-- Image placeholder: Ratel connection screen -->

You're now connected! Click **Continue** to access the console.


## Step 4: Run Your First Query

In Ratel's **Query** tab, paste this [DQL](dgraph-glossary#dql) query:

```dql
{
  film(func: has(genre), first: 3) {
    name@*
    genre { 
      name: name@. 
    }
    starring {
      performance.actor {
        name: name@.
      }
      performance.character {
        name: name@.
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<img src={QueryTab} alt="Ratel Console" style={{width: 400}} />

Click **Run** to execute the query. This finds movies with genres and displays their details, including actors and characters.

**What this query does:**
- Finds nodes that have a `genre` predicate
- Returns the first 3 results
- Retrieves movie names, genres, and starring information

## Step 5: Explore the Results

View your results in two ways:

1. **JSON tab** - See the raw data structure
2. **Graph tab** - Visualize the relationships

Switch to the **Graph** tab to see how movies, genres, actors, and characters are connected.
