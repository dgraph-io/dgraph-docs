title: Secure Alter Operations
---

Alter operations allow clients to apply schema updates and drop predicates from the database. By default, all clients are allowed to perform alter operations.

You can secure alter operations using token authentication. See [Admin Endpoint Security](../security/admin-endpoint-security#securing-alter-operations) for detailed configuration instructions.

For enterprise-grade access control, see [Access Control Lists](../enterprise-features/access-control-lists).
