title: Aliases
---
import RunnableCodeBlock from '@site/src/components/RunnableCodeBlock';



Syntax Examples:

* `aliasName : predicate`
* `aliasName : predicate { ... }`
* `aliasName : varName as ...`
* `aliasName : count(predicate)`
* `aliasName : max(val(varName))`

An alias provides an alternate name in results.  Predicates, variables and aggregates can be aliased by prefixing with the alias name and `:`.  Aliases do not have to be different to the original predicate name, but, within a block, an alias must be distinct from predicate names and other aliases returned in the same block.  Aliases can be used to return the same predicate multiple times within a block.

Query Example: Directors with `name` matching term `Steven`, their UID, English name, average number of actors per movie, total number of films, and the name of each film in English and French.
<RunnableCodeBlock>

```dql
{
  ID as var(func: allofterms(name@en, "Steven")) @filter(has(director.film)) {
    director.film {
      num_actors as count(starring)
    }
    average as avg(val(num_actors))
  }

  films(func: uid(ID)) {
    director_id : uid
    english_name : name@en
    average_actors : val(average)
    num_films : count(director.film)

    films : director.film {
      name : name@en
      english_name : name@en
      french_name : name@fr
    }
  }
}
```
