Welcome to Dgraph! This guide will get you up and running in minutes. You'll learn how to start Dgraph, load sample data, and run your first queries.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed and running
- A terminal window
- About 5 minutes

## Step 1: Create Quickstart Working Directory 

Create a directory to work from while following the guide, and open a terminal session in that directory. 

For example: 

```bash
mkdir ~/Desktop/dgraph-quickstart
cd ~/Desktop/dgraph-quickstart
``
## Step 2: Start Dgraph

From the directory you created, run Dgraph using the official Docker image:

```bash
docker run --detach --name dgraph-play \
  -v $(pwd):/dgraph \
  -p "8080:8080" \
  -p "9080:9080" \
  --pull always dgraph/standalone:latest
```
This command:
- Starts Dgraph in the background (`--detach`)
- Names the container `dgraph-play` for easy management
- Mounts your current directory to `/dgraph` in the container
- Exposes ports 8080 (HTTP) and 9080 (gRPC)

**Verify it's running:**

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/health  | jq '.[0].status'
```

Or, if `jq` is *not* installed on your system:

```bash
(curl http://localhost:8080/health 2>/dev/null | grep -q '"status":"healthy"' && echo "healthy")  || echo "NOT healthy"
```
Either will output `healthy` if everything is OK.

## Step 3: Download Sample Data

Download the sample dataset (movie data) to the working directory you created: 

```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph-benchmarks/raw/refs/heads/main/data/1million.rdf.gz
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dgraph-io/dgraph-benchmarks/refs/heads/main/data/1million.schema
```

## Step 4: Load Sample Data

Load the data into Dgraph:

```bash
docker exec -it dgraph-play dgraph live \
  -f 1million.rdf.gz \
  -s 1million.schema
```

This loads over 1 million movie-related facts into your database. The process takes about 15-30 seconds.

## Step 5: Open Ratel UI

[Ratel](dgraph-glossary#ratel) is Dgraph's visual query interface. Start it with:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 8000:8000 dgraph/ratel:latest
```

And then navigate to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser.

Ratel should start already configured to connect to your local Dgraph instance.  
You can confirm by verifying that the text underneath the 'lightning' connection button at the top of left side toolbar shows "http://localhost:8080".

If it does not:
   1. Click on the connection icon.
   1. Enter `http://localhost:8080` as the Dgraph connection string
   2. Click **Connect**

<!-- Image placeholder: Ratel connection screen -->

You're now connected! Click **Continue** to access the console.

## Step 4: Run Your First Query

In Ratel's **Query** tab, paste this [DQL](dgraph-glossary#dql) query:

```dql
{
  film(func: has(genre), first: 3) {
    name@*
    genre { 
      name: name@. 
    }
    starring {
      performance.actor {
        name: name@.
      }
      performance.character {
        name: name@.
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<img src={QueryTab} alt="Ratel Console" style={{width: 400}} />

Click **Run** to execute the query. This finds movies with genres and displays their details, including actors and characters.

**What this query does:**
- Finds nodes that have a `genre` predicate
- Returns the first 3 results
- Retrieves movie names, genres, and starring information

## Step 5: Explore the Results

View your results in two ways:

1. **JSON tab** - See the raw data structure
2. **Graph tab** - Visualize the relationships

Switch to the **Graph** tab to see how movies, genres, actors, and characters are connected.
