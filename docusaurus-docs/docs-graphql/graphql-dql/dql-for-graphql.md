title: "Use DQL in GraphQL"

---



Dgraph Query Language ([DQL](/dql/)) can be used to extend GraphQL API capabilities when writing:

- [custom DQL resolvers](/graphql/[custom-dql](custom-dql))
- [subscriptions on DQL queries](/graphql/[directive-withsubscription](directive-withsubscription))



When writing custom DQL query resolvers, you must understand the [GraphQL - DQL schema mapping](/graphql/[graphql-dql-schema](graphql-dql-schema)) to use proper aliases inside DQL queries to map them to the GraphQL response.
