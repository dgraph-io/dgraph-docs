title: "Use DQL in GraphQL"

---



Dgraph Query Language ([DQL](/dql/)) can be used to extend GraphQL API capabilities when writing:

- [custom DQL resolvers](/graphql/custom)
- [subscriptions on DQL queries](/graphql/schema/directive-withsubscription)



When writing custom DQL query resolvers, you must understand the [GraphQL - DQL schema mapping](/graphql/graphql-dql/graphql-dql-schema) to use proper aliases inside DQL queries to map them to the GraphQL response.
