title: "@auth"

---

`@auth` allows you to define how to apply authorization rules on the queries/mutation for a type.

Refer to [graphql endpoint security](/graphql/security/), [RBAC rules](/graphql/security/RBAC-rules) and [Graph traversal rules](/graphql/security/graphtraversal-rules) for details.


`@auth` directive is not supported on `union` and `@remote` types.
