title: "@auth"

---

`@auth` allows you to define how to apply authorization rules on the queries/mutation for a type.

Refer to [graphql endpoint security](/graphql/[graphql/security/_index](graphql/security/_index)), [RBAC rules](/graphql/[RBAC-rules](RBAC-rules)) and [Graph traversal rules](/graphql/[graphtraversal-rules](graphtraversal-rules)) for details.


`@auth` directive is not supported on `union` and `@remote` types.
