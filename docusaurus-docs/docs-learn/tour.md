## A Tour of Dgraph

Get hands-on experience with Dgraph through our interactive, self-guided tutorial. The Tour of Dgraph walks you through the fundamentals step by step—from your first query to advanced graph operations—all in a local environment with a pre-loaded sample dataset.

### What You'll Learn

The tour covers both DQL (Dgraph Query Language) and GraphQL, teaching you:

- How to query and traverse graph data
- Schema design and data modeling
- Mutations and CRUD operations
- Search, filtering, and pagination
- Variables, blocks, and advanced query patterns

### Running the Tour

The tour runs locally using Docker. For setup instructions, available commands, and development information, see the [Tour of Dgraph repository](https://github.com/dgraph-io/tour).
