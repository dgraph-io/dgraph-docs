With the GraphQL backend deployed and serving the schema, you can move directly
to building a UI.

This section of the tutorial walks you through building a UI using React and Typescript with the [GraphQL Code Generator](https://graphql-code-generator.com/).

All of the code for building the React app for this tutorial is available on GitHub in the [Message Board App Tutorial repo](https://github.com/dgraph-io/discuss-tutorial).
