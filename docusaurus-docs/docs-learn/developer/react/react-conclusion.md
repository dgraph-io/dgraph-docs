Congratulations on finishing the Dgraph Learn course: **Build a Message Board App
in React**!

You’ve now learned how to add much of the core functionality to your React app.
In the advanced course (coming soon), you’ll add login and authorization, 
subscriptions, and custom logic to this app.

Playing with your app and taking your code to the next level? Be sure to share
your creations on our [discussion boards](https://discuss.dgraph.io).
We love to see what you’re working on!
