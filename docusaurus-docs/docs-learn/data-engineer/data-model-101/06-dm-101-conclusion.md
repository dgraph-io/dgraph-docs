Congratulations on finishing the Dgraph learn course: **Graph Data Models 101**!

Now that you have an overview and understanding of
- [what a graph is](/learn/data-engineer/data-model-101/dm-101-introduction),
- how a graph differs from a
[relational model](/learn/data-engineer/data-model-101/relational-data-model),
- [how to model a graph](/learn/data-engineer/data-model-101/graph-data-model),
- and [how to query a graph](/learn/data-engineer/data-model-101/graph-query),

you are ready to jump into using Dgraph, the only truly native distributed graph database.

Check out [Dgraph Cloud](https://dgraph.io/cloud).
