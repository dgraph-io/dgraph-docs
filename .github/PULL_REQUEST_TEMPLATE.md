Your title must be in the following format: topic(area): details
- The "topic" should be be one of the following: Docs, Nav or Chore
- The "area" is the feature (i.e., GraphQL"), area of the docs (i.e., "Deployment"), or "Other" (for typo fixes and other bug-fix PRs). 

Sample Titles:
Docs (GraphQL): Document the @deprecated annotation Chore (Other): cherry-pick updates from master to release/v20.11

Please develop in the `master` branch when you can, so that we cherry-pick out of `master`, not into `master`.

Please add a description with these things:
1. A brief, clear description explaining the problem and what you changed.
2. Link to any related PRs or discuss.dgraph.io posts.
3. If this PR corresponds to a Jira issue, include "Fixes DGRAPH-###" or "Per Dgraph-###" in the PR description.
3. If this is a breaking change, please put "[Breaking]" in the title. In the description, please put a note with exactly who these changes are breaking for.
